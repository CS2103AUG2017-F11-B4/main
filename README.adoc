== Target Audience

* This Address Book application is primarily designed with University students in mind.
* Problems:
** In a Univesity setting, there are many opportunities for collaboration. However, with the multitude of collaboration platforms available (e.g. Slack, Telegram, Github etc.), collecting user information for individual platforms quickly becomes tedious.
** Beyond work-related collaborations, University is also a place for expanding one's social network. However, the context does not often provide an opportunity for group mates to request for each other's social profiles (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook etc.)
* Solution:
** Address Book Pro aims to be a unified platform where users can collect all important information of their group mates, all in one go.
** Address Book Pro also provides an easy-access to group mates' social media profiles, which serves to faciliate networking.

* This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* What's different from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[level 3]:
** A more sophisticated GUI that includes a list  panel and an in-built Browser.
** More test cases, including automated GUI testing.
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.
